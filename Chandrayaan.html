                <strong>Chandrayaan 3</strong>
            </section>
            <p>Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe
                landing and roving on the lunar surface. It consists of Lander and Rover configuration. It will be
                launched by LVM3 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota. The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover
                configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. The propulsion module has Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet
                Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar
                orbit.
                Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous Lander module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and a Rover with an
                objective of developing and demonstrating new technologies required for Inter planetary missions. The
                Lander will have the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which will
                carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The Lander
                and the Rover have scientific payloads to carry out experiments on the lunar surface. The main function
                of PM is to carry the LM from launch vehicle injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and
                separate the LM from PM. Apart from this, the Propulsion Module also has one scientific payload as a
                value addition which will be operated post separation of Lander Module. The launcher identified for
                Chandrayaan-3 is LVM3 M4 which will place the integrated module in an Elliptic Parking Orbit (EPO) of
                size ~170 x 36500 km.

        <strong class="head" id="Mission">Why is Chandrayaan-3 important for India?</strong> <br>
        <p class="para"> Chandrayaan-3 will be the first mission to investigate the Moon's South Pole, whereas most
            lunar missions have focused on the equatorial region. The mission's proximity to the Pole provides important
            insights into lunar water exploration, even if it won't physically land there. The mission will draw
            attention to India's involvement in the current race for permanent infrastructure on Moon.<br></p>

        <strong class="head">What are the benefits of Chandrayaan-3?</strong><br>
        <p class="para"> Chandrayaan-3 is set to unearth treasures available on the lunar surface. As per the ISRO's
            website, the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft will â€œmeasure the near-surface plasma (ions and electrons) density and
            its changes with time; carry out the measurements of thermal properties of the lunar surface near-polar
            region; ensure seismicity around the landing site and delineating the structure of the lunar crust and
            mantle; derive the chemical Composition and infer mineralogical composition to further our understanding of
            Lunar-surface, and will determine the elemental composition of Lunar soil and rocks around the lunar landing
            site".<br></p>

        <strong class="head">How many days did Chandrayaan-3 take to reach the moon?</strong><br>
        <p class="para"> On July 14, 2023, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched the historic
            Chandrayaan-3 mission. And it is set to touch down the lunar surface on August 23, 2023, at 18:04 IST. So,
            this means it took a span of over 40 days to reach Chandrayaan-3.
        </p>
        <strong class="head">Why will Chandrayaan-3 only land on the South Pole?</strong>
        <p class="para" id="gallery">Chandrayaan-3's mission focuses on the lunar South Pole, a location of significant
            interest, in an effort to find water on the Moon. The craters in this polar region have the most potential
            for water, according to previous missions and remote sensing data. Also, scientists believe that it might
            contain a sizable amount of ice that might be used for drinking water, fuel, and oxygen extraction.
